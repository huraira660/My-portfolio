					<p>
						My favorite personality is <b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b>. He was
						one of the leading personalities of Pakistan and also called the
						father of the nation. He was born on 25th of December, 1876 in a
						noble family of Karachi. His father name was Jinnah Poonja and his
						mother name was Mithibai. He was the eldest child of his family.
						Muhammad Ali Jinnah was very talented and able person. He is one of
						my favorite person and ever. He had done very memorable and leading
						work in the field of law and politics. The Jinnah’s work toward a
						new nation is very remarkable and memorable in the history of
						Pakistan. Our nation and Government had done so many things in the
						memory of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
					</p>
					<h1>Education</h1>
					<p>
						He received his early education from Karachi Mission School. He
						passed his Matriculation in 1895 from Sindh Madrassa to Islam. After
						he went to England and took Barrister degree from Lincoln’s Inn. He
						started practice in law in Mumbai. In 1907 he became a successful
						lawyer. He was very interested in politics and started participating
						in politics.
					</p>
					<h1>Membership and Leadership:</h1>
					<p>
						Indian National Congress was one of the big organizations in India.
						In 1906 Jinnah has joined the Indian National Congress. Later on
						25th of January 1910 he became the member of sixty members Imperial
						Legislative Council. In 1913 he became the member of Muslim league
						and later on, he became the President of Muslim League in 1916. In
						1920 Jinnah left National Congress party and became the President of
						Muslim League. He, later on, bought out a program which is comprised
						of fourteen points of action and therefore, it became popularly
						known as Jinnah’s Fourteen Points. He was also the President of
						Pakistan’s Constituent Assembly.
					</p>
					<h1>Death</h1>
					<p>
						In spite of great struggle for getting a new nation, this young man
						cannot live long. He had been suffering from tuberculosis which
						leads to lungs cancer and he died on 11th of September on 1948. The
						government of Pakistan has constructed big mausoleum at the funeral
						place of Jinnah. His house name Jinnah house is still under the
						possession of the Government of India and still is the big conflict
						to be solve and is not clear till now. Further, you can edit this My
						Favorite Personality Essay with outlines according to your own
